# Youtube Data API
 Google provides a large set of API’s for the developer to choose from. Each and every service provided by Google has an associated API. Being on of them, [Youtube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs) is very simple to use provides features like –

Search for videos
Handle videos like retrieve information about a video, insert a video, delete a video etc.
Handle Subscriptions like lists all the subscriptions, insert or delete a subscription.
Retrieve information about comments like replies to a specific comment identified by a parentId etc.

In this project I am fetching youtube users information and Statistics with the help of google API.
